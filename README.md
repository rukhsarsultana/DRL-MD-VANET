# DRL-MD-VANET
DRL model for misbehavaior detection in VANET, is trained using a small combined attack dataset, demonstrates the capability to detect multiple attacks with high efficiency. Moreover, it continuously adapts to variations observed in the VANET environment.
Here the Python code for training and testing is provided. Additionally, a sample of training dataset (combination of 19 attack datasets for VeReMi extension) and individual attack dataset for testing is provided.
